This directory contains tutorial materials for FoX.

iFaX.1 covers basic XML generation with WXML, iFaX.3 
includes XPath using python, iFaX.4 concerns the SAX interface, 
and iFaX.5 concerns the DOM interface.
(Other tutorials will appear when they are complete).

In both cases, the .tgz file contains the contents of the relevant directory.

Each tutorial consists of a single document (in three formats, text, html, and pdf)
and a series of accompanying exercises (in the Practical subdirectory).

All materials in iFaX.4 and iFaX.5 are copyright Toby White <tow@uszla.me.uk> 2008. iFaX.1 and iFaX.3 are copyright Toby White
and Andrew Walker 2008.
