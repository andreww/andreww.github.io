        <p>I became a certified instructor for <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> following some intensive and rather 
          enjoyable training in Norwich in 2014. Since 
          then I have regularly acted as lead- or co-instructor for short workshops 
          designed to enhance the computational and data skills of researchers at all 
          levels (graduate students to faculty) in universities and other research 
          organisations. I also occasionally contribute to lesson 
          development, mentor new instructors, and regularly participate in UK Carpentries 
          community meetings. My experience of teaching these workshops 
          has heavily influenced my approach to teaching programming to 
          undergraduate students studying the Earth sciences. Along the 
          way, I contributed to and led some significant training 
          activities for researchers in the UK environmental sciences.

        <h2>Essential Scientific Computing for Environmental Scientists (2023 and 2024)</h2>
        <p>Led by Dr Chris Wood at EPCC and funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, 
          we’ve developed and delivered a series of workshops for researchers in the environmental sciences. 
          These were delivered online and in person (in Oxford, Edinburgh and Liverpool) and consisted of Carpentries 
          lessons modified to fit within the context of the environmental sciences alongside some additional material. 
          Different variants of these workshops are aimed at novice, intermediate and advanced learners and some 
          contain novel "bring your own data" sessions. We’re currently in the process of developing an 
          application for funding for another round of workshops scheduled for 2025.</p>
          
        <h2>"Beyond the code", "Further beyond the code", and "Software craftsmanship for environmental scientists" (ATSC 2015 - 2017)</h2>
        <p>We ran a series of nine modified software carpentry workshops
          in Leeds and Bristol as part of three successive projects funded
          by the 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17 Advanced Training Short Course
          scheme of the Natural Environment Research Council (I was principal investigator). 
          These workshops built on the two day Carpentries format by adding co-designed group 
          software development projects. Our grant application which describes the need for 
          and design of these workshops can be found on <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1206320.v1">Figshare</a>.
